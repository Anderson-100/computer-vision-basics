Modern color cameras work by having each pixel detect the intensity of a single color (red, green, or blue). However, since it is impossible for every pixel to be exactly one color, some sort of algorithm is implemented to estimate the missing values of each pixel. For example, if the current pixel only detects red, we would need to estimate the green and blue values of this pixel.

In this program, we test the effectiveness of a Nearest Neighbors algorithm for estimating missing pixel values.
