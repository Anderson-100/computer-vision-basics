# Align RGB Channels

Before the invention of modern color cameras, photographers envisioned the idea of one day having multicolor images by taking three images—with a blue, green, and red filter—and stacking them on top of each other.

This program emulates that idea by stacking blue, green, and red filtered images on top of each other and aligning them as best as possible to achieve this multicolor effect.
